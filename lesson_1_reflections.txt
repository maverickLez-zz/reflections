How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

->During refactoring of code if some new changes are made then intentionally/unintentionally if bug has been inserted then if previous version has been bug-free then diff will help to figure out a way to fix that bug

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

->By having easy access to entire history of file make us know about evoluation of file 
to became less receptive to bugs in adding new features efficiently & effectively

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

-> pros are separting versions based on logical changes and cons are doing every time a logical changes are made manually saving.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

-> As one commit in repo takes snapshot in time frame  

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

-> use it directly

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

->

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
